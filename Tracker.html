                 <ol>C# is most popular among bigger established businesses,
                   often for building internal software.
                   Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft,
                   it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market.
                   C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately,
                   with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform,
                   porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the
                   best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a
                   larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.</ol>

                 <ol>Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications.
                    If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information,
                    and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby.
                    Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby,
                    simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications.
                    It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.</ol>
