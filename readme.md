# Track Suggester

#### _Project#2 for Epicodus, August 10, 2018_

#### By _**Mark Mangahas**_

## Description
As you know, Epicodus students must decide which track they would like to pursue before they enroll. While all languages have similarities, and switching between languages and platforms is very common in both internships and jobs, applicants should still choose the track they wish to complete with care. Currently, Epicodus offers the following tracks in Portland and Seattle:

Ruby/Rails
CSS/React
C#/.NET
(All tracks must complete Intro and JavaScript.)

For this Independent Project, please first revisit our blog post "What Programming Language Should I Learn?" regarding choosing a track, as well as the course descriptions for each track. You may also research on other sites if you need more information about a track other than your own.

Then, create a Track Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) that asks future students a series of questions about themselves and provides a track suggestion based on their answers. You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant.

Include a minimum of 5 survey questions.
Offer 3 different track suggestions.
Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in tone.
